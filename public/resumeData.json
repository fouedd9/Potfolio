    "bio": "I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for online security, and a passion for coding and modeling 3D. Born in a small town in Tunisia, I made my move to Paris  where I graduated with a master's degree in web development at the digital school of Paris, in parallel to my many ongoing projects. I love to create and I tend to have too many projects going on at the same time. Outside of work, I'm a roller, a passionate soccer referee. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I built much of my first portfolio from the beaches of Malaga Spain and I dream of being able to take my work with me when I travel the world..",
